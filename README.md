# DiamondPrices

In this project I used the "Diamond Prices" dataset obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nancyalaswad90/diamonds-prices) to investigate what factors influence the value of a diamond. Analysis was conducted in Python using Jupyter Notebooks and a variety of Exploratory Data Analysis techniques.
